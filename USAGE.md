A Basic Script in D
-------------------
Make sure you have [DUB](http://code.dlang.org/download) v1.0.0 or later installed. You can check your version of DUB by running `dub --help`. Then. using Scriptlike in a D script is easy:

```d
#!/usr/bin/env dub
/+ dub.sdl:
	name "myscript"
	dependency "scriptlike" version="~>0.9.6"
+/
import scriptlike;

void main(string[] args) {
	string name;
	if(args.length > 1)
		name = args[1];
	else
		name = userInput!string("What's your name?");

	writeln("Hello, ", name, "!");
}
```

You don't even need to download or install Scriptlike! DUB will do that automatically, thanks to the `dependency` line in the special `dub.sdl` comment section. (Learn [more about this feature of DUB](http://code.dlang.org/getting_started#single-file-packages), introduced in DUB v1.0.0.)

On Linux/OSX, you can then run that script just like any shell script:

```bash
$ chmod +x myscript.d
$ ./myscript.d Frank
Hello, Frank!
```

As long as you have a D compiler installed (DMD, LDC or GDC), that will cause DUB to automatically download/install all dependencies (in this case, just Scriptlike), recompile the script if necessary, and run it.

Or if you're on Windows (this will also work on Linux/OSX, too):
```batch
> dub myscript.d Frank
Hello, Frank!
```

NOTE: Due to [an issue](https://github.com/dlang/dub/issues/907) in DUB, if you use this single-file approach and you need to use [thisExePath](semitwist.com/scriptlike/scriptlike/file/wrappers/thisExePath.html) (or the [Phobos equivalent](http://dlang.org/phobos/std_file.html#thisExePath)), then you won't get the expected result. The `thisExePath` function will NOT return the path to the `myscript.d` script, it will simply return the temporary path where DUB stored the compiled binary. I'm not aware of any way to work around this while using DUB's single-file feature, so if your script needs to obtain its own path (remember, `args[0]` is famously unreliable for this in any language), then try one of the older approaches below.

Older approaches
================

In a DUB-based project
----------------------
If your project uses [DUB](http://code.dlang.org/getting_started), just include the scriptlike as a dependency in your [dub.json](http://code.dlang.org/package-format?lang=json) or [dub.sdl](http://code.dlang.org/package-format?lang=sdl) file like this:

dub.json:
```json
"dependencies": {
	"scriptlike": "~>0.9.6"
}
```

dub.sdl:
```
dependency "scriptlike" version="~>0.9.6"
```

And then import with one of these:

```d
// Imports all of Scriptlike, plus anything from Phobos likely to
// be useful for scripts:
import scriptlike;

// Or import only Scriptlike and omit the automatic Phobos imports:
import scriptlike.only;
```

Run your project with dub like normal:

```bash
$ dub
```

In a plain script
----------------------

Assuming you have [DMD](http://dlang.org/download.html#dmd) and [DUB](http://code.dlang.org/download) installed:

myscript.d:
```d
import scriptlike;

void main(string[] args) {
	writeln("This script is in directory: ", thisExePath.dirName);

	string name;
	if(args.length > 1)
		name = args[1];
	else
		name = userInput!string("What's your name?");

	writeln("Hello, ", name, "!");
}
```

myscript.sh:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$(dirname "$0")/$(readlink "$0")")"
rdmd -I~/.dub/packages/scriptlike-0.9.6/scriptlike/src/ -of$SCRIPT_DIR/.myscript $SCRIPT_DIR/myscript.d "$@"
```

myscript.bat:
```batch
@echo off
rdmd -I%APPDATA%/dub/packages/scriptlike-0.9.6/scriptlike/src/ -of%~dp0.myscript %~dp0myscript.d %*
```

On Linux/OSX:
```bash
$ chmod +x myscript.sh
$ ln -s myscript.sh myscript
$ dub fetch scriptlike --version=0.9.6
$ ./myscript Frank
Hello, Frank!
```

On Windows:
```batch
> dub fetch scriptlike --version=0.9.6
> myscript Frank
Hello, Frank!
```

FAQ

### Why not just use a shebang line instead of the bash helper script?

**Short:** You can, but it won't work work on other people's machines.

**Long:** D does support Posix shebang lines, so you *could* omit the `myscript` file and add the following to the top of `myscript.d`:

```bash
#!/PATH/TO/rdmd --shebang -I~/.dub/packages/scriptlike-0.9.6/scriptlike/src/
```

Problem is, there's no way to make that portable across machines. The rdmd tool isn't always going to be in the same place for everyone. Some people may have it in `/bin`, some may have it in `/opt/dmd2/linux/bin64`, `/opt/dmd2/linux/bin32` or `/opt/dmd2/osx/bin`, some people install via [DVM](https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dvm) (which I recommend) which puts it in `~/.dvm/compilers/dmd-VERSION/...`, and some people simply unzip the [DMD](http://dlang.org/download.html#dmd) archive and use it directly from there.

What about `/usr/bin/env`? Unfortunately, it can't be used here. It lacks an equivalent to RDMD's `--shebang` command, so it's impossible to use it in a shebang line and still pass the necessary args to RDMD.

Additionally, using the shebang method on Posix would mean that invoking the script would be different even more between Posix and Windows than simply slash-vs-backslash: `myscript.d` vs `myscript`.

### Why the -of?

**Short:** So rdmd doesn't break [```thisExePath```](http://semitwist.com/scriptlike/scriptlike/file/wrappers/thisExePath.html).

**Long:** Without ```-of```, rdmd will create the executable binary in a temporary directory. So if your program uses [```thisExePath```](http://semitwist.com/scriptlike/scriptlike/file/wrappers/thisExePath.html) to find the directory your program is in, it will only get the temporary directory, instead of the directory with your script.

Of course, if your program doesn't use [```thisExePath```](http://semitwist.com/scriptlike/scriptlike/file/wrappers/thisExePath.html), then it doesn't matter and you can omit the ```-of```.

Why even use [```thisExePath```](http://semitwist.com/scriptlike/scriptlike/file/wrappers/thisExePath.html) instead of ```args[0]```? Because ```args[0]``` is notoriously unreliable and for various reasons, will often not give you the *real* path to the *real* executable (this is true in any language, not just D).

### What's with the ```$SCRIPT_DIR``` and ```%~dp0``` stuff?

**Short:** So you can run your script from any directory, not just its own.

**Long:** Those are the ways to get the directory of the currently-running script in Posix/Windows shells. This way, if you run your script from a different working directory, rdmd will look for your D file is the correct place, rather than just assuming it's in whatever directory you happen to be in.

Note that on OSX, you will still need to run the script from it's own directory (unless you run a symlink to the script, then you can still run the symlink from any directory). This is because OSX doesn't implement ```readlink -f``` and plain old ```readlink``` only produces output for symlinks.

### Why bother with the symlink? Why not just rename ```myscript.sh``` to ``myscript```?

**Short:** So you can run your script from any directory, not just its own...*on OSX*.

**Long:** Normally you could use ```"$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")"``` to get ```$SCRIPT_DIR```. But ```readlink -f``` is reported to not work on OSX (and some other BSDs, although it worked for me on OpenBSD 10.2). So plain old ordinary ```readlink``` is needed. But that *only* works on actual links. Hence, the symlink to ```myscript.sh```.

### Why have the Windows executable named ```.myscript.exe```? Why not just name it ```myscript.exe```?

**Short:** Consistency, and to not hijack the .bat file.

**Long:** On Windows, .exe files take precedence over .bat, so the next time you run ```myscript``` it'll *seem* to work, but will run the .exe directly, not the .bat. So it won't recompile when you change ```myscript.d```.

The leading dot also provides consistency with the Posix script, which is helpful when working in out modern cross-platform world.
